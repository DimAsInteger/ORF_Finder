ORF_Finder searches for open reading frames (ORFs) which may correspond to protein coding regions in a FASTA formatted 
DNA sequence inputed by the user. The program allows visualization of the 6 reading frames and prompts the user to enter the reading frame of choice and specifiy the length of the ORF.  
Afterwards, the program returns the range of each ORF for the requested frame along with its start position, stop position, and sequence length. Finally, the program breaks the ORF into 
triplicate codons for possible further use with proteomics.
